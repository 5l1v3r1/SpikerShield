# Heart and Brain SpikerShield 

With our [Heart and Brain](https://backyardbrains.com/products/heartAndBrainSpikerShieldBundle) (EEG/EKG) SpikerShield Bundle, you can view and record the action potentials of your heart and the slow rhythms of your brain using a Computer running our free Spike Recorder Software. In order to connect Arduino to our software you will have to upload this sketch to Arduino board:

 - Communication with SpikeRecorder desktop aplication ([SpikeRecorderMuscleSpikerShield_V1_1.ino](Arduino Code/SpikeRecorder/SpikeRecorderMuscleSpikerShield_V1_1.ino))
 
If you want to connect Heart and Brain SpikerShield to Matlab you can check our simple Matlab example [readSR.m](Documentation/Matlab/readSR.m) that can read 10 seconds of EEG or EKG signal from one SpikerShield's channel.
