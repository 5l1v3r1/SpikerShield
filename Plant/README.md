# Plant SpikerShield

Use our Plant SpikerShield to record the electrical voltages generated by plants such as the [Venus Fly Trap](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/Plants), the [Sensitive Mimosa](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/Plants_Mimosas), and others. Discover the understudied, ripe for opportunity, world of plant electrophysiology with our [Plant SpikerBox](https://backyardbrains.com/products/plantspikerbox) and [Spike Recorder software](https://backyardbrains.com/products/spikerecorder).
In order to connect Arduino to our [Spike Recorder software](https://backyardbrains.com/products/spikerecorder) you will have to upload this sketch to Arduino board:

 - Communication with SpikeRecorder desktop aplication. For Arduino UNO [SpikeRecorderSpikerShield_V1_1.ino](Arduino%20Code/SpikeRecorder/SpikeRecorderSpikerShield_V1_1.ino) For Arduino Leonardo [PPILeonardo_V1-0.ino](Arduino%20Code/PPILeonardo_V1-0/PPILeonardo_V1-0.ino)
 
If you want to connect Plant SpikerShield to Matlab you can check our simple Matlab example [readSR.m](Documentation/Matlab/readSR.m) that can read 10 seconds of EEG or EKG signal from one SpikerShield's channel.
